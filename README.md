# product-profile
This repository provides an overview of methodologies used for Product Healthiness Profile assessments by ATNi over time. It serves as a resource for understanding how nutrient profiling models have been applied by ATNi in its Global Indexes, country level assessments and thematic assessments. 
# What is Nutrient profiling
Nutrient profiling is the science of classifying foods based on their nutritional composition to prevent disease and promote health. It helps identify which foods contribute to a healthy diet and supports policies that influence consumer choices and food formulation.

|`GI_Global-Index_TGI-product-profile_Methodology_2018.pdf`|This document sets out the methods used by The George Institute for the study: ‘The comparative nutritional profile of food and beverage products marketed by the 21 largest global companies in 9 countries’, carried out for ATNF during 2017, for use in the 2018 Global Access to Nutrition Index.
| `GI_Global-Index_TGI-product-profile_Report_2018.pdf` |Report on the comparative nutritional profile of food and beverage products marketed by the 21 largest global companies in 9 countries. Prepared by the George Institute for Global Health for the Access to Nutrition Initiative, for use in the 2018 Global Access to Nutrition Index. Nutrient information for 23,013 packaged food and beverage products in selected categories, made by the 21 manufacturers, was included in this analysis. Nutrient information was obtained either from product packaging or directly from the manufacturer and supplemented with imputed data.|
| `GI_Global-Index_TGI-product-profile_2021-2-1.pdf` | Report on the comparative nutritional profile of food and beverage products marketed by the 25 largest global companies in 25 countries. Prepared by the George Institute for Global Health for the Access to Nutrition Initiative, for use in the 2021 Global Access to Nutrition Index. Nutrient information for 41,071 packaged food and beverage products in selected categories, made by the 25 manufacturers, was included in this analysis. Nutrient information was obtained either from product packaging or directly from the manufacturer and supplemented with imputed data.|
| `Global-Index-2024-methodology-FINAL3.pdf` | Report on the comparative nutritional profile of food and beverage products marketed by 30 of the largest global companies in 25 countries. Prepared by the George Institute for Global Health for the Access to Nutrition Initiative, for use in the 2024 Global Access to Nutrition Index. Nutrient information for 53,315 packaged food and beverage products in selected categories, made by the 30 manufacturers, was included in this analysis. Nutrient information was obtained either directly from the manufacturer or from Innova Market Insights. |

# Nutrient Profiling models in scope
| Nutrient Profiling Model name |Country/region of origin |Date of development/versions|Original purpose|Nutrients included in the model|Original scoring system|
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|HSR, Health Star Rating|Australia|2014 (updated 2020)|Negative nutrients score is combined with positive nutrients score to arrive at a final ‘score’ which is then converted to a Health Star Rating from 0.5 to 5.0.|Energy, Saturated fat, Total sugars, Sodium, Fibre, Fruit, vegetables, nuts and legumes (FVNL), Calcium, Artificial sweeteners|Front-of-pack nutrition labelling.|Depending on which category the product falls in, the ‘score’ is converted to a Health Star Rating from 0.5 to 5.0 stars that can be displayed in a logo on the front of pack.
|Kenyan Nutrient Profiling Model|Kenya|2016|The model is presented in tabular format and consists of 21 categories of processed foods and components that are subject to restriction, namely, total and saturated fats, total sugars and sodium per 100g/mL. The Kenyan model is very similar (and appears based on) the WHO AFRO model.|Total fat, Saturated fat, Total sugars, Artificial sweeteners, Trans fat, Sodium|The model was developed to underpin front-of-pack labelling requirements in Kenya. The draft standard specifies the requirements of the application of front-of-pack nutrition labelling to pre-packaged food products related to the levels of total fat, saturated fat, total sugars and sodium.
|Nutri-Score|Europe|2027(updated 2023)|Negative nutrients score is combined with positive nutrients score to arrive at a final ‘score’ which is then converted to a scaled rating from ‘A’ (most healthy) to ‘E’ (least healthy).|Energy, Saturated fat, Total sugars, Sodium, Fibre, Fruit, vegetables, legumes, Artificial sweeteners|Depending on which category the product falls in, the ‘score’ is converted to a coloured scaled rating from ‘A’ (most healthy) to ‘E’ (least healthy).
|WHO Euro|Europe|2015 (updated 2024)|Products must not exceed category-specific thresholds per 100g/mL to be permitted to market to children.|Energy, Total fat, Saturated fat, Total sugars, Added sugars, Artificial sweeteners, Trans fat, Sodium|Regulation of marketing to children.|Depending on the product category, marketing to children is either never permitted (e.g. for confectionery), or only permitted if the product does not exceed specified thresholds of negative nutrients per 100g/mL.|
|WHO Afro|Africa|2016|Products must not exceed category-specific thresholds per 100g/mL to be permitted to market to children.|Energy, Total fat, Saturated fat, Total sugars, Added sugars, Artificial sweeteners, Trans fat, Sodium|Regulation of marketing to children.|Depending on the product category, marketing to children is either never permitted (e.g. for confectionery), or only permitted if the product does not exceed specified thresholds of negative nutrients per 100g/mL.|
